## [1.10] - 2025-04-15

### üöÄ Overview

Initial public release of **Unicode to png**, a CLI tool written in Python that converts Unicode emoji into browser-compatible PNG icons. This version introduces full emoji rendering support, standardized output sizes, batch processing, structured logging, and GitHub community files for open source collaboration.

---

### ‚ú® Added

- **Command-line Interface (CLI)** with support for:
  - `--emoji` for single emoji rendering.
  - `--batch` for processing multiple emojis with alias support.
  - `--folder` to specify output location.
  - `--quiet` for silent operation in automation contexts.
- **Rendering Engine** using Pillow and Segoe UI Emoji:
  - High-resolution canvas rendering and downsampling via `Image.LANCZOS`.
  - Support for emojis using Zero Width Joiners (ZWJ).
- **Output Generation**:
  - PNG icon sizes: `16x16`, `19x19`, `32x32`, `38x38`, `48x48`, `128x128`.
  - Saved under `/emojis/<base>_<alias>/` with naming convention `emoji_{size}.png`.
- **Logging System**:
  - Log files are only created on warnings/errors.
  - Named as `YYYYMMDD_<folder>.log` in a dedicated `/log` directory.
- **Folder and filename sanitization** to prevent invalid characters and file conflicts.

---

### üõ† Infrastructure & Tooling

- Created `.gitignore` to exclude `__pycache__`, `env/`, and temporary logs.
- Added `requirements.txt` with `Pillow>=9.0`.
- Verified Python 3.6+ compatibility.
- Modular structure with `main()`, `parse_args()`, `parse_batch()`, `load_font()`, and `log()`.
