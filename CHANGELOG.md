- README image previews were replaced with Markdown examples to reduce stale visual documentation.
- New Python modules and tests now include the project MPL source header.
- README release badge now uses the GitHub latest release badge instead of a hardcoded version value.
- Repository links were normalized to `https://github.com/del-Pacifico/unicode-to-png`.
- GitHub issue templates were aligned with the current dependency and logging standards.

## 🧾 Changelog

### v1.19 — 2025-05-21

#### 🔍 Technical Review Summary (v1.19)

Unicode to PNG v1.19 introduces a robust and production-ready emoji rendering pipeline focused on stability, performance, and developer automation. The inclusion of smart margin correction, logging, and Unicode compliance transforms it into a professional tool for browser extension developers and designers alike.

Key architectural improvements include modularization of logic blocks, isolated error handling, and memory-safe canvas workflows. CI/CD readiness is achieved through silent mode, batch operations, and consistent output structure.

All code is now guided by strong engineering principles:
- Resilience to edge cases
- Predictable resource cleanup
- Defense against invalid input
- Log-auditable execution flows

---

#### ✨ Added

- `--autofixmargin` flag: auto-detects edge clipping and re-renders with padding.
- `--margin <float>`: allows manual margin setting (e.g., `--margin 0.25`).
- Unicode-aware rendering engine that supports:
  - Skin tone modifiers (`👍🏿`)
  - ZWJ sequences (`👩‍🚒`, `👨‍👩‍👧‍👦`)
  - Presentation selectors and flag tags
- Logging system that:
  - Records overwrites, warnings, and render issues.
  - Outputs log files to `log/YYYYMMDD_<folder>.log`
- CLI `--batch` support for emoji:alias pairs (e.g., `🔥:fire,🎨:palette`)
- Silent execution mode via `--quiet` (no console output, logs still saved).
- Folder/alias sanitization for filesystem-safe names.
- Modular structure with fully isolated functions:
  - `parse_args()`, `parse_batch()`, `load_font()`, `log()`, `prepare_log_path()`
- New section in README:
  - `💖 Support the Project` with donation badges and links.
- Added project-wide quality badges (privacy, modular design, AI-assisted).
- Section `🛡️ Engineering Principles` explaining performance and stability principles.

#### 🔄 Changed

- Emoji rendering now uses 4× resolution canvas and high-quality `Image.LANCZOS` downsampling.
- Bounding box calculation improved using `draw.textbbox()` for precision centering.
- Logging timestamps now follow format `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]`.
- Minimum Python version raised to `3.6+` (recommended `3.11+`).
- Font loading made fault-tolerant with fallback handling.
- Technical Design section expanded to include modular architecture, validations, and CLI design.
- README completely overhauled:
  - Sections rewritten: Description, Features, How It Works, Options, Use Cases
  - Added command-line usage examples for all flag combinations
  - Enhanced Table of Contents for accuracy and anchor sync

#### 🛠️ Fixed

- Bug where emojis were clipped at the top/right edges due to tight bounding box.
- Issue where ZWJ sequences produced misaligned output.
- Rendering errors that occurred silently without feedback are now logged properly.

### 🧹 Removed

- Implicit emoji rendering without input validation.
- Redundant or inconsistent print messages.
- Unclear margin handling logic replaced with formal CLI options.

#### 🔐 Security

- Emoji and folder inputs are fully sanitized (`[a-zA-Z0-9_]` only).
- No filesystem overwrite without clear log trace.
- All external input errors are isolated and reported gracefully.

---

## [Unreleased]

### 🛠️ Fixed

- Updated GitHub Actions workflow for CodeQL analysis:
  - Migrated from deprecated `@v2` to `@v3` (`init` and `analyze`).
  - Added required `permissions` block (`security-events: write`) to allow GitHub to process results.
  - Noted that CodeQL scanning results are only visible in repositories under a GitHub **Organization** account.

### 📘 Documentation

- Updated `README.md` with clarified AI badge groups and improved layout.
- Added `## 🏷️ Project Qualities` section to highlight privacy, modularity, and AI-assisted development.
- Linked `SECURITY.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` via a new section: `## 📚 Governance & Ethics`.
- Declared the use of tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT (OpenAI), and Google Gemini in both policies.

### 🔧 Metadata & Style

- Maintained consistent badge styles and groupings.
- Ensured headers follow TOC-compatibility (e.g. badge sections are `##` level).
- Added markdown-friendly visual spacing between badge groups using `<br>` and comments.

### ℹ️ Notes

- Although CodeQL analysis runs correctly on push and pull requests, results will not appear in the **Security > Code scanning alerts** tab unless the repository belongs to a GitHub **Organization** account. This is a GitHub Advanced Security limitation.

## [1.12] - 2025-04-17

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

- Fixed a folder duplication bug where using `--folder fire` incorrectly created `fire_fire`. Now the folder is named exactly as provided by the user.
- Fixed missing emoji validation: the script now only accepts valid Unicode emoji symbols and rejects non-emoji characters (e.g., regular letters or punctuation).

### ✨ Features & Improvements

- Added full Unicode emoji validation using defined emoji Unicode blocks.
- Improved the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block:
  - Uncaught exceptions are now logged in a fallback file located at `log/YYYYMMDD_error.log`.
  - The script now exits with `sys.exit(1)` on failure, signaling errors properly to external scripts or CI pipelines.

### 📘 Documentation & Presentation

- Added a `Visual Preview` section to the `README.md` that includes:
  - `cli_demo.png`: Example of CLI usage
  - `output_preview.png`: Folder overview with generated emoji image set
  - `emoji_sizes_detail.png`: All PNG sizes produced from a sample emoji
- Clarified that only valid Unicode emoji are accepted as input (`README.md`, under How It Works).
- Added a footer badge block to visually highlight key project qualities: No tracking, Modular, Lightweight, Open Source.

### 🛡️ Security & Licensing

- License updated from **MIT** to **Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)** to ensure proper attribution and openness while protecting original work.
- Updated project header badge to reflect MPL-2.0.
- Added recommended MPL license header block to the main script file (`unicode_to_png.py`), including author and GitHub project URL.

### 📁 Project Infrastructure

- Added `.github/FUNDING.yml` to support GitHub Sponsors.
- Added `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` to enable automatic CodeQL-based static security scanning for Python.

This version introduces full emoji rendering support, standardized output sizes, batch processing, structured logging, and GitHub community files for open source collaboration.

---

### ✨ Added

- **Command-line Interface (CLI)** with support for:
  - `--emoji` for single emoji rendering.
  - `--batch` for processing multiple emojis with alias support.
  - `--folder` to specify output location.
  - `--quiet` for silent operation in automation contexts.
- **Rendering Engine** using Pillow and Segoe UI Emoji:
  - High-resolution canvas rendering and downsampling via `Image.LANCZOS`.
  - Support for emojis using Zero Width Joiners (ZWJ).
- **Output Generation**:
  - PNG icon sizes: `16x16`, `19x19`, `32x32`, `38x38`, `48x48`, `128x128`.
  - Saved under `/emojis/<base>_<alias>/` with naming convention `emoji_{size}.png`.
- **Logging System**:
  - Log files are only created on warnings/errors.
  - Named as `YYYYMMDD_<folder>.log` in a dedicated `/log` directory.
- **Folder and filename sanitization** to prevent invalid characters and file conflicts.

---

### 🛠 Infrastructure & Tooling

- Created `.gitignore` to exclude `__pycache__`, `env/`, and temporary logs.
